      <h1>Hey! My name is Tanushree Gangwal. I am a Full Stack Developer</h1>
      <p>I have been working as a Full Stack Developer since 2021, blending my problem-solving skills with a passion for coding. My journey into web development began in college, where I discovered the intersection of design and functionality. While I don't consider myself a designer, I excel at translating pre-designed concepts into clean, efficient code, ensuring that every project is executed flawlessly from concept to completion.
<br>
        With over 3 years of experience, I specialize in crafting dynamic, user-centric, and scalable web applications. My expertise lies in building robust backends with Node.js, creating interactive frontends using Angular, and managing databases with MySQL and PostgreSQL. I am proficient in the MEAN stack, skilled in designing responsive UI components with Angular Material and Bootstrap 5, and experienced in building RESTful APIs, working with Elasticsearch queries, and integrating third-party services.
        <br>
        My passion for development drives me to continually learn and grow, ensuring I can always deliver the best possible solutions for every project.</p>
